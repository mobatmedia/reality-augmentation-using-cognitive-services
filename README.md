# Overview

Augmented reality is hot. Artificial intelligence is hot. Combining the two to create an augmented view of reality where pictures can be identified, tracked, and labeled with meaningful text is a truly fun and exciting experience. This page describes how to use [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/beta) and [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) to create a desktop application to do just that. The application can be run as-is on the desktop emulator, and it can also be deployed onto the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).

The application uses the [Microsoft Computer Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/), part of Microsoft Cognitive Services, to extract meaningful text from images. [Vuforia](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/Object-Recognition) is used for image detection and tracking. [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) is used to create script actions that call out to the Computer Vision API and also to deploy the application to the HoloLens.
